They lowered these to more realistic values (500K → 5K).\n2. **Improved dataset & code quality scoring** - Increased points awarded for passing quality checks\n3. **Removed unhelpful metrics** - Dropped the \"spaces\" key from Hugging Face cards since it provided no contributor info\n\n## **Team Members**\n- Anjali Vanamala\n- Pryce Tharpe\n- Shaantanu Sriram\n- Andrew Diab\n\nPretty solid software engineering project with real deployment! 🚀",

      "content": "# Assumptions About the Hardest Part\n\nBased on the documentation provided, I would assume **the hardest part was the storage architecture migration from in-memory to DynamoDB**, for several reasons:\n\n1. **Explicit Time Investment**: The document directly states that the team \"spent much longer debugging, implementing, and refactoring code in the backend for seamless integration from memory -> DynamoDB.\" This is the only component explicitly called out as requiring extended effort.\n\n2. **Complexity of Integration**: Migrating from in-memory storage to a distributed database requires:\n   - Rearchitecting data access patterns\n   - Handling eventual consistency concerns\n   - Refactoring backend logic across multiple services\n   - Testing integration between ECS tasks and DynamoDB\n   - Debugging runtime issues that don't appear in development\n\n3. **Cross-cutting Impact**: Unlike discrete tasks (like setting up IAM roles or configuring API Gateway), a storage layer migration affects numerous parts of the codebase and requires coordinated changes across the entire backend.\n\n4. **Context from Metrics Work**: The ECE 461 notes mention \"considerable amount of time going through, validating the metrics, and changing them where necessary\" with extensive manual testing—but this is framed as validation work. The DynamoDB migration is the only component described with language emphasizing the difficulty of the *implementation* itself.\n\nThe secondary challenge would likely be **establishing and validating appropriate security metrics** (as evidenced by the metric threshold adjustments), but this appears to have been resolved through systematic validation rather than fundamental architectural difficulty.",

The team manually added up his commits and lines from merged PRs, providing concrete evidence of his work despite the missing screenshot.\n\nIf Andrew had substantial non-code contributions (documentation, testing, architecture planning, etc.), those could also be mentioned to provide fuller context for the evaluation.",
